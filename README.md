[![Codacy Badge](https://www.codacy.com/project/badge/fa1e21dc6de24e0cb5286e7579e0698d)](https://www.codacy.com/app/pjazdzewski1990/scala-slack-bot-core)

# Purpose 

Provide an easy integration with [Slack](https://slack.com/) instant messaging platform using Scala language in an easy to use Akka-like environment. This project provides the core functionality allowing one to connect, listen for messages and send messages to channels or as DMs. 

## What is it good for?

* for integrating various in-house or third party tools into your messaging platform, thus creating a communication and control hub

## What is it NOT good for?

* creating rich web-like GUIs 

# How can I get started?

The easiest way to get started is to read our [blog post](http://blog.scalac.io/2015/07/16/slack.html) and fork our [example project](https://github.com/pjazdzewski1990/scala-slack-bot-example). In case you need more examples feel free to take a look at the bundle [we are using](https://github.com/ScalaConsultants/scala-slack-bot).

# Can I contribute? 

Sure you can! We are open to contributions and new ideas. You don’t have to ask for permission to improve this project, but consider few tips before opening a pull request. They are here not to curb your enthusiasm, but to help us grow in an predictable way.  Everyone is free to suggest improvements, comment and send patches.

## How to make contributing pleasant for me and others?

* If you have an idea for improvement or new feature, consider creating an [issue](create issues link) before writing the code. This way you can get feedback from other people early. We don’t want to reject any help, but some ideas might sound really great in your head but writing them down shows their flaws. Writing simple WHY and HOW for an idea inside a task will help you to catch mistakes early on 
* After infecting other people with your ideas it’s time to code your next big thing. New feature branches should start in `develop` branch and after all the work is done you should open a Pull Request back into that branch. Adding a sort description and tagging people interested is a good custom.
* In order to pass a code review your code needs to get at least one :+1: from people that already contributed to this repository. The thumbs should be given under the whole repo, if given under a change they will be considered as an appreciation to the given change. Don’t give a thumb for your own code - we believe you approve that code, if not you wouldn’t send it in the first place. 
* You don’t have to apply all the changes suggested by reviewers, but please respect the time they spent looking at your code and reply to their comments. Best code comments point out an issue and suggest a possible solution. The second best type of comment is showing appreciation for good code. * If you feel that a comment is rude, take into account that non-verbal communication usually feels more offensive that it really is. Especially when it comes to working with people from other cultures or people less proficient with english. Nobody is here to attack you. If the comment shows signs of a  verbal abuse (for instance swear words targeted at someone, stereotypes), contact us - we will make sure it won’t happen again.
* After the code is ready to go, author merges it into `develop`.
* When `develop` accumulates enough improvements or an important bug fix  has been added there, then it gets merged into `master` and a new version is released. For early versions releases depend on fixes, but later on we will move to timely deploys. 

Thank you and happy hAkking!
